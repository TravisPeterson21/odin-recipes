    <p>Korean BBQ is a style of cooking and eating in which various meats, usually beef, pork, or chicken, are grilled at the table over a gas or charcoal grill. The meat is often marinated in a variety of sauces and spices, giving it a unique and flavorful taste. In addition to the meat, Korean BBQ often includes a variety of side dishes, such as rice, kimchi (spicy fermented vegetables), pickled vegetables, and lettuce leaves.

        Korean BBQ is typically served family-style, with the grilled meat being shared among the diners. The meat is cooked to the diner's desired level of doneness and then cut into bite-sized pieces with scissors. The meat is then wrapped in lettuce leaves along with the side dishes, creating a flavor-packed bite. Some Korean BBQ restaurants also offer additional dipping sauces and condiments to enhance the flavor of the grilled meat.
        
        Korean BBQ is a social and interactive dining experience, with diners cooking their own meat at the table and sharing food with each other. It has become increasingly popular worldwide, with many Korean BBQ restaurants opening in major cities around the world.</p>
